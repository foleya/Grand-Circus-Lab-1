# Grand-Circus-Lab-1

Write a Java Console program to perform the following task:
Input: Your program should read two integer numbers from the user with the same
number of digits (example: number1= 234, number2 = 564).

Task: Check if each corresponding place in the two numbers (ones, tens, hundreds, …)
sums to the same total.

Output: Your program should print out: True or False based on the result.
Examples:

Number1 = 153 , Number2 = 345 => 1+3 ≠ 5+4 ≠ 3+5Program prints False.

Number1 = 543 , Number2 = 456 => 5+4 = 4+5 = 3+6 Program prints True.

Things to look for:
- Do proper validation on the user’s input.
- Write the task in a separate method.
- Provide adequate comments.
- Provide adequate user prompts.
